<p> I am graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2022 with a degree in <strong>Media and Professional Communication</strong> with a certificate in <strong>Leadership</strong>. I am currently on the <strong>job search</strong>, looking for a position that will utlize my experience and passions while teaching me more about the commuincations, marketing and sales fields. </p>

<h2 id="creations">Creations</h2>

<div class="flexbox">
    <p> Here you will see some of my most recent creations. I love communications and the freedom and creativity that comes with the professional field. Please enjoy some of the visuals I have designed. Creating is a passion of mine especially when they are projects about subject and/or people that mean a lot to me. </p>
    <li> This project was created in 2022, for my Composing Digital Media course we were asked to create a visual argument. After many revisions and peer/advisor feedback I put together this final visual. This graphic argues that education in the prison system can break the once arrest, always arrest pipeline.</li>
    <img alt="visual of prison system cycle with light in the form of education breaking the cycle" src="images/finaldraft00.png">
    <li> This project was created in 2022 for my Persuastive Writing in Advertising course. The class was given a few random images and asked to create a print ad for any company. I decided to focus on the headphone sof the image and relate it to Headspace. Headspace is an online company that specializes in meditation and mental health.</li>

    <li> This collage was create in 2022 for my sorority at The University of Pittsbrugh. I made this for recruitment to promote sisterhood to the potential new memebers going through recruitment. </li>
