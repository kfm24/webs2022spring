    <p1> This project was created in 2022, for my Composing Digital Media course we were asked to create a visual argument. After many revisions and peer/advisor feedback I put together this final visual. This graphic argues that education in the prison system can break the once arrest, always arrest pipeline.</p1>

    <p1> This project was created in 2022 for my Persuastive Writing in Advertising course. The class was given a few random images and asked to create a print ad for any company. I decided to focus on the headphone sof the image and relate it to Headspace. Headspace is an online company that specializes in meditation and mental health.</p1>
