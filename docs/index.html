    <h1>The Best Hire You Will Ever Make</h1>
    <p>I have a lot to learn and a lot to offer. I am graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in May 2022 with a degree in <strong>Media and Professional Communication</strong> with a certificate in <strong>Leadership</strong>.</p>

    <h2><p style="color:lightblue;">About Me</p></h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
  <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
  <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to be in touch,<br/>
Kaitlyn</p>
